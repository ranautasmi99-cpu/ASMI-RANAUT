# Student Record Management System

This project is a small Python application created to keep track of basic student information such as ID, name, branch, and year. The idea behind the project is to have a simple system that can store and manage records without using a full database. Everything is stored in a JSON file, which makes it easy to read, update, and maintain.



## Overview

The program runs in the terminal and uses a menu-based structure, so it’s easy to follow even for beginners. It allows the user to add new students, check existing records, search for a particular student, make changes to stored details, and remove entries when needed. All the core operations are handled through Python code, which interacts with the JSON file in the background.



## Features

- Add new student details  
- View all stored records  
- Search for a student by their ID  
- Update existing information  
- Delete records that are no longer required  
- Data stored safely in a JSON file  

These features cover the basic requirements of a simple record-keeping system.
